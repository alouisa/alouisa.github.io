                    <p>Jessie is 31 year old and has a bachelors degree in Education. 
                        Ahe is  married and currently works as a stay at home mom to 2 kids, one of which is 
                         attending Oakwood elementary school. Despite being home most the 
                         time Jessie is very social with her neighbors and with the other 
                         parents that she sees at the elementary school drop off and pick up. Jessie mostly
                         uses her ipad and phone to search the internet, keep up to date with information
                         about her childs school, and to stay in touch with family out in other towns. Jessie
                         is great at planning events and is often the person in her family that puts together
                         family get togethers and reunions.

                    <h3>Roger</h3>
                    <p>Roger is a 71 year old retired widower who lives alone except for his dog. Aside from taking his
                       dog on walks, he likes to occassionally go fishing at Bear Lake. Roger has a couple of long time friends
                       in the neighborhood as well as some children and grandchildren in the area. Roger keeps to himself most the 
                       time and is a somewhat quiet individual, but he does like small talk and visits from family and friends. 
                       Aside from the times his children and grandchildren visit, Roger does not have much help navigating
                       media devices and tends to stick to navigating the internet with his trusty desktop computer.</p>
