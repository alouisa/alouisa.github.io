            <h3>LocalStorage Notes:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Reminder: "Think, Test, Design, Create"</li>
                <li>Output- info stored or shared with the user
                </li>
                <li>IO - "Input-Output"</li>
                <li>Add text before input so user has hint of what to enter</li>
                <li>textarea has a placeholder attribute that is overwritten when user types</li>
                <li>onclick attribute used to link buttons to their required actions (javascript functions)</li>
                <li>Make input elements user friendly. This includes making textareas large enough for the user to view their text and potentially changing the background color to draw attention to that area of the page.</li>
                <li>value property can be used to get the current value inside of an input element</li>
                <li>localStorage.getItem()</li>
                <li>localStorage.setItem()</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>LocalStorage Reading Questions:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>We are asked to place the three buttons in a section tag to get the page to display the way we want to, but aren't sections required to have some sort of header in them? Wouldn't it make more sense to put them in a div tag?</li>
                <li>Same questions as #1 in reference to the empty tag for displaying the story. Why isn't a div tag used instead of a section tag since it has no type of header tag within in?</li>
                <li></li>
            </ol>
