            <h3>LocalStorage Questions:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>We are asked to place the three buttons in a section tag to get the page to display the way we want to, but aren't sections required to have some sort of header in them? Wouldn't it make more sense to put them in a div tag?</li>
                <li>Same question as #1 in reference to the empty tag for displaying the story. Why isn't a div tag used instead of a section tag since it has no type of header tag within in?</li>
            </ol>
