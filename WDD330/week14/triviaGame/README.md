# Description

This application was created as my individual college final for my Javascript class. This site was create during the beginning of my Web Development journey. Using data in the trivia API found at 'https://opentdb.com/api_config.php', I created a trivia game that allows an individual to select a certain category, test their knowledge, and get their score at the end. Beyond its demonstration of Javascript skill, this application is another demonstration of playful animation and styling.

# Technologies

HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript
